# To ensure secure and reproducible builds, we use dependency pinning with hash verification for our build tools (like pipenv and wheel).
# requirements.in: This is the source file. It lists our direct top-level dependencies. Edit this file if you need to add or change a package.
#
# requirements.txt: This is the generated lockfile. It contains the exact versions and cryptographic hashes for all packages and their sub-dependencies. Do not edit this file manually.
#
# How to Update Dependencies
# If you need to add a package or update versions, follow these steps:
#
# Prerequisite: Install pip-tools if you haven't already:
# command: pip install pip-tools
#
# Edit Source: If adding a new package, add it to requirements.in.
#
# Compile & Generate Hashes: Run the following command in the project root. This will resolve dependencies, fetch the latest hashes from PyPI, and update requirements.txt:
# command: pip-compile --generate-hashes --allow-unsafe requirements.in
# flag --allow-unsafe flag tells pip-tools to treat "unsafe" packages (like setuptools) as normal packages that must be pinned.
#
# Commit: Commit both requirements.in and the updated requirements.txt.
