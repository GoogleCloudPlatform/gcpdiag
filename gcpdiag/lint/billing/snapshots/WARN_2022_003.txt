   Cost insights are part of the Recommender service, and you can use them to
   find important patterns in your costs. For example, you see a cost insight in
   the Insights API if your costs for a day are significantly higher or lower
   than your typical daily costs. You can use this information to find out if
   some of your resources are getting more usage than expected, and take action
   to optimize your costs.
