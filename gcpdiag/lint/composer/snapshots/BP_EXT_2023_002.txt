     env1 image is composer-1.17.10-airflow-1.10.15, which is vulnerable to XSS attack. Upgrade to the latest Cloud Composer version

   Airflow UI in Airflow 2.2.3 or earlier versions is vulnerable to
   CVE-2021-45229. "Trigger DAG with config" screen was susceptible to XSS
   attacks through the origin query argument. Highly recommended to upgrade to
   the latest Cloud Composer version that supports Airflow 2.2.5.
