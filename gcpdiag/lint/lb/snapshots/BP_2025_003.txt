*  lb/BP/2025_003: Connection draining timeout is configured for proxy load balancers.
   - projects/gcpdiag-lb1-aaaa/global/backendServices/web-backend-service [FAIL]
     Connection draining timeout is not configured (set to 0 seconds).

   Performance best practices recommend configuring connection draining timeout
   to allow existing requests to complete when instances are removed from a
   backend service.
