   The maximum amount of nodes in a GKE cluster is limited based on its pod CIDR
   range. This test checks if the cluster is approaching the maximum amount of
   nodes allowed by the pod range. Users may end up blocked in production if
   they are not able to scale their cluster due to this hard limit imposed by
   the pod CIDR.
