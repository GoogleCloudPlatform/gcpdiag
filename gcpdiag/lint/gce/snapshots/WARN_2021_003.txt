   A GCP project should have Cloud Monitoring API enabled. The service account
   attached to the GCE VM instances should have the monitoring.metricWriter IAM
   role permission. Also, a GCE instance should have the monitoring.write access
   scope. Without these, Ops Agent won't be able to collect metrics from GCE VMs
   and display on Metrics Explorer.
