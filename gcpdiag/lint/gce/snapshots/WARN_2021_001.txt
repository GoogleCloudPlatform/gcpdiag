   A GCP project should have Cloud Logging API enabled. The service account
   attached to the GCE VM instances should have the logging.logWriter IAM role
   permission. Also, a GCE instance should have the logging.write access scope.
   Without these, Ops Agent won't be able to collect logs from GCE VMs and
   display on Logs Explorer.
