"""GCE Instances follows access scope best practice

Google recommends not to rely on access scopes but instead set the cloud-platform access
scope and control the service account access by granting fine-grained IAM roles.
Enabling a custom service account with very coarse-grained permissions
and a very restricted access scope will ensure the connection
to or from the VM is limited and implements a security-in-depth strategy where multiple
layers of security are used for holistic protection.
