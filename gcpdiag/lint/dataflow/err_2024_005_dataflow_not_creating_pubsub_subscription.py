"""Dataflow and its controller service account have the necessary permissions to interact with Pub/Sub topics.

This rule ensures your Dataflow jobs have the `pubsub.subscriber` role to read messages,
and the controller service account has the `pubsub.topics.get` permission (typically included in `pubsub.viewer`)
to manage subscriptions. Without the correct permissions, Dataflow jobs will fail to create subscriptions,
resulting in `GETTING_PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION_FAILED` errors and disrupting your data pipelines.
