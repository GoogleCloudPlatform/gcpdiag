interconnect/bgp-down-flap: This runbook analyzes BGP down and BGP flap events for a GCP project in a clolud region.

  The following steps are executed:

  - Check BGP down status: Check if any vlan attachment has BGP down state.
  - Check Interconnect maintenance: Check if there are interconnect maintenance events
           are associated with the BGP down vlan attachments.
  - Check BGP flap status: Check if any BGP flaps happened.
  - Check Cloud Router maintenance: Check if there were Cloud Router maintenance events
           are associated with the BGP flaps.

  
[START]: Check provided parameters.

   - gcpdiag-interconnect1-aaaa                                           [OK]
     [REASON]
         `VLAN attachments` found in project.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check if there is vlan attachment has BGP down.
[INFO]:     The interconnect `dummy-interconnect2` attachment `dummy-attachment4` has `BGP` down.


   - gcpdiag-interconnect1-aaaa                                           [FAIL]
     [REASON]
         `BGP` down events found.

     [REMEDIATION]
          Check if interconnects with BGP down are in maintenance state. Analyze Cloud Router logs to identify the root cause. Refer to the Cloud Router log messages documentation for guidance. <https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/support/infrastructure-maintenance-events>

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check if any BGP down interconnects are in maintenance state.
[INFO]:     The interconnect `dummy-interconnect2` with `BGP` down has no planned maintenance.


   - gcpdiag-interconnect1-aaaa                                           [FAIL]
     [REASON]
         The Interconnects with `BGP` down have no planned maintenance.

     [REMEDIATION]
         Analyze Cloud Router logs to identify the root cause. Refer to the Cloud Router log messages documentation for guidance. <https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/router/support/troubleshoot-log-messages>

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check if there are BGP flap events.
[INFO]: 
[INFO]: There are Cloud Router BGP flaps over 60s: 
[INFO]: ['6988249776642123456', '169.254.2.1', 'went down', '2025-03-27T23:32:19.397757310Z']
[INFO]: ['6988249776642123456', '169.254.2.1', 'came up', '2025-03-27T23:34:39.923120483Z', '140.0']

   - gcpdiag-interconnect1-aaaa                                           [FAIL]
     [REASON]
         `BGP` flaps lasting longer than 60 seconds detected in project `gcpdiag-interconnect1-aaaa`.

     [REMEDIATION]
         BGP flaps lasting longer than 60 seconds have been observed. These are unlikely to be caused by Cloud Router or Interconnect maintenance events. Analyze Cloud Router logs to identify the root cause. Refer to the Cloud Router log messages documentation for guidance.<https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/router/support/troubleshoot-log-messages>

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check if the Cloud Router had maintenance event.

   - gcpdiag-interconnect1-aaaa                                           [OK]
     [REASON]
         `BGP` flaps (duration < 60s) coincide with `Cloud Router maintenance` events.

[END]: Finalizing connectivity diagnostics.
