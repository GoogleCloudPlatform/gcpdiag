interconnect/bgp-down-flap: This rule book analyzes BGP down and BGP flap events in a region of a project.

  The following steps are executed:

  - Check BGP down status: Check if any vlan attachment has BGP down state.
  - Check Interconnect maintenance: Check if there are interconnect maintenance events
           are associated with the BGP down vlan attachments.
  - Check BGP flap status: Check if any BGP flaps happened.
  - Check Cloud Router maintenance: Check if there were Cloud Router maintenance events
           are associated with the BGP flaps.

  
[START]: Check provided parameters.

   - gcpdiag-interconnect1-aaaa                                           [OK]
     [REASON]
         Vlan attachments are found in the project.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check if there is vlan attachment has BGP down.
[INFO]:     The interconnect dummy-interconnect2 attachment dummy-attachment4 has BGP down.


   - gcpdiag-interconnect1-aaaa                                           [FAIL]
     [REASON]
         BGP down events are found. Further debugging is needed.

     [REMEDIATION]
         Continue next step to check if there are interconnect maintenance events.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check if any BGP down interconnects are in maintenance state.
[INFO]:     The interconnect dummy-interconnect2 with BGP down has no planned maintenance.


   - gcpdiag-interconnect1-aaaa                                           [FAIL]
     [REASON]
         The Interconnects with BGP down have no planned maintenance.

     [REMEDIATION]
         Please continue to check router logging. Further debugging is needed.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check if there are BGP flap events.
[INFO]: 
[INFO]: There are Cloud Router BGP flaps over 60s: 
[INFO]: ['6988249776642123456', '169.254.2.1', 'went down', '2025-03-27T23:32:19.397757310Z']
[INFO]: ['6988249776642123456', '169.254.2.1', 'came up', '2025-03-27T23:34:39.923120483Z', '140.0']

   - gcpdiag-interconnect1-aaaa                                           [FAIL]
     [REASON]
         The project gcpdiag-interconnect1-aaaa has BGP flaps with a duration over 60s.

     [REMEDIATION]
         Please continue to check router logging. Further debugging is needed.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check if the Cloud Router had maintenance event.

   - gcpdiag-interconnect1-aaaa                                           [OK]
     [REASON]
         BGP flaps less than 60s are all caused by Cloud Router maintenance events.

[END]: Finalizing connectivity diagnostics.
[INFO]: If any further debugging is needed, consider please contact GCP support for further troubleshooting
