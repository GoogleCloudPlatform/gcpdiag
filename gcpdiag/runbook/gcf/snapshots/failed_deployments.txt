gcf/failed-deployments:  Cloud Run function failed deployments check

  This runbook will assist users to check reasons for failed deployments of Gen2 cloud functions.
  Current basic Validations:
  - Check for existence of Default SA
  - Check for existence of Cloud function Service Agent
  - Check for existence of cloud functions Service Agent and its permissions
  - Check for error logs for global scope code errors and resource location constraint.
  
[START]: Check if cloud function region and name is specified.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check if cloud run function default service account and agent exists and is enabled.

   - gcpdiag-gcf1-aaaa                                                    [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The cloud run function service agent or default service account either do not exist or are not enabled:
     https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/iam#access_control_for_service_accounts

     [REMEDIATION]
     Review the IAM roles guide for providing default roles to cloud run function default service account and the service agent:
     https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/iam#serviceaccount

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check if User/Service account has permissions on Cloud function runtime service account
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check for deployment failures due to global scope code errors

   - gcpdiag-gcf1-aaaa                                                    [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     This error indicates that there was a problem with your code. The deployment pipeline finished deploying the function,
     but failed at the last step- sending a health check to the function. This health check is meant to execute a functions global scope,
     which could be throwing an exception, crashing, or timing out.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Please use the following document as reference to address this error:

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check for deployment failures due to resource location constraint

   - gcpdiag-gcf1-aaaa                                                    [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     If your organization uses a resource location constraint policy,
     it restricts function deployment in the regions restricted by the policy.
