cloudrun/service-deployment: Investigates the necessary GCP components searching for reasons for deployment errors.

  This runbook will examine the following key areas:

  1. Container and code Checks.
    - Ensures the Container is in correct state to run in Cloud Run

  Scope of Investigation:
    - Note that this runbook does not provide troubleshooting steps for errors
      caused by the code running in the container.
  
[START]: Verifying context and parameters required for deployment runbook checks.
[COMPOSITE STEP]: Checking for common container and code issues.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verifying if there is an error that container failed to start.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verifying if specified image exists.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verifying if Cloud Run service agent can fetch the image.
[END]: Finalizing runbook investigations...

     [REASON]
     Provided image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/gcpdiag-cloudrun2-aaaa/cloudrun-repository/missing-image does not exist.

     [REMEDIATION]
     The provided image does not exist. Make sure that it is correct. Try following
     quickstart guide and see how to correctly specify image names. https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts

     [REASON]
     Cloud Run Service agent service-123400010@serverless-robot-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com does not have permissions to read image gcr.io/private-project/image..

     [REMEDIATION]
     Please make sure that service-123400010@serverless-robot-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com has roles/storage.objectViewer role if the image is stored in Container
     Registry or roles/artifactregistry.reader if in Artifact Registry. Please note that the role needs to be granted in the
     project where the image is stored.
