cloudrun/service-deployment: Investigates the necessary GCP components searching for reasons for deployment errors.

  This runbook will examine the following key areas:

  1. Container and code Checks.
    - Ensures the Container is in correct state to run in Cloud Run

  Scope of Investigation:
    - Note that this runbook does not provide troubleshooting steps for errors
      caused by the code running in the container.
  
[START]: Verify context and parameters required for deployment runbook checks.
[COMPOSITE STEP]: Checking for common container and code issues.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify if there is an error that container failed to start.

   - gcpdiag-cloudrun2-aaaa/4ca2c930-7962-4fce-9470-987642372120          [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Container failed to start in service invalid-container.

     [REMEDIATION]
     The container failed to start. Refer to <https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/troubleshooting#container-failed-to-start> for guidance.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify if specified image exists.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify if Cloud Run service agent can fetch the image.
[END]: Finalize runbook investigations.

     Grant service-123400010@serverless-robot-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com the roles/storage.objectViewer role if the image is stored in Container Registry or the roles/artifactregistry.reader role if in Artifact Registry. Note that the role must be granted in the project where the image is stored.
