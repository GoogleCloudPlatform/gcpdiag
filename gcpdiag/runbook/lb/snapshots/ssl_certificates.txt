certificate_name=cert1,project_id=gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa

lb/ssl-certificates: This runbook diagnoses and troubleshoots issues with SSL certificates.

  The supported certificates are Google-managed classic certificates attached to
  load balancers.

  It helps identify and resolve common problems that prevent certificates from
  provisioning or functioning correctly.

  Key Investigation Area:

  - Certificate Status:
    - Checks the certificate's provisioning status and identifies any failed
    domains.
  - Domain Validation:
    - Verifies DNS configuration for each domain, ensuring proper A/AAAA records
    and the absence of conflicting records.
  - Load Balancer Configuration:
    - Confirms the certificate is correctly attached to a target proxy and
    associated with a forwarding rule using port 443.
  - Conflicting resources:
    - Ensures no certificate map is attached to the target proxy, which can
    interfere with Google-managed certificates.
  - Provisioning Time:
    - Checks Cloud Logging to determine when the certificate was attached and
    allows sufficient time for propagation.
  
[START]: Verify the existence and status of the SSL certificate "cert1".
[INFO]: name: cert1

   - gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa                                                     [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The Google-managed SSL certificate "cert1" is not in ACTIVE state.

[GATEWAY]: Analyze the status of the Google-managed SSL certificate "cert1".

   - projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/sslCertificates/cert1               [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     The Google-managed SSL certificate "cert1" is in the PROVISIONING state. Further investigation into the status of each domain is necessary..

[GATEWAY]: Check the status of each individual domain associated with the SSL certificate "cert1".
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Analyze domains in FAILED_NOT_VISIBLE state for certificate "cert1".

   - projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/sslCertificates/cert1               [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The following domains are in FAILED_NOT_VISIBLE state: natka123.com, second.natka123.com for SSL certificate "cert1". This usually means the domain's DNS records aren't correctly pointing to your load balancer.

[GATEWAY]: Verify the SSL certificate "cert1" is attached to a target proxy.

   - projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/sslCertificates/cert1               [OK]
     [REASON]
     The SSL certificate "cert1" is attached to target proxies (projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/targetHttpsProxies/https-lb-proxy) that are in use by forwarding rules.

[GATEWAY]: Verify the DNS records for domain "natka123.com" associated with the SSL certificate "cert1".

   - projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/sslCertificates/cert1               [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     Some DNS records for domain natka123.com resolve to the following unexpected IP address(es): 1.2.3.5.  While other records point to the expected IP addresses: 1.2.3.4. The unexpected IP addresses do not point to any load balancer associated with certificate cert1. This can cause certificate provisioning issues.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Configure DNS records for natka123.com to point to the correct load balancer IP address(es) for certificate cert1.

     The following load balancer IP addresses are associated with this certificate:

     - forwarding rule "https-content-rule" in "global": 1.2.3.4


     Check: https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates/google-managed-certs#update-dns

[GATEWAY]: Verify the DNS records for domain "second.natka123.com" associated with the SSL certificate "cert1".

   - projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/sslCertificates/cert1               [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     DNS records for domain second.natka123.com currently resolve to the following IP addresses: 2600:1901:0:d0d7::. These IP addresses do not point to any load balancer associated with certificate cert1. Certificate provisioning is therefore blocked.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Configure DNS records for second.natka123.com to point to the correct load balancer IP address(es) for certificate cert1.

     The following load balancer IP addresses are associated with this certificate:

     - forwarding rule "https-content-rule" in "global": 1.2.3.4


     Check: https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates/google-managed-certs#update-dns

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check if the load balancer with certificate "cert1" is configured to listen on port 443.

   - projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/sslCertificates/cert1               [OK]
     [REASON]
     The SSL certificate "cert1" has forwarding rules configured for HTTPS (port 443) on all associated IP addresses.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check for conflicting certificate map set on a target proxy for certificate "cert1".

   - projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/sslCertificates/cert1               [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The following target proxies have a conflicting certificate map:

     Target Proxy: projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/targetHttpsProxies/https-lb-proxy has certificate map //certificatemanager.googleapis.com/projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/locations/global/certificateMaps/cert-map together with classic SSL certificates https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/sslCertificates/cert1.

     If certificate map is set on a target proxy, the classic SSL certificates are ignored.

     [REMEDIATION]
     If this is not intended, please detach the certificate map from the target proxies.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check if the SSL certificate "cert1" associated resources has been updated recently.

   - projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/sslCertificates/cert1               [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     The SSL certificate "cert1" has recently had associated resources modified. This might affect DNS validation. Details are below:
     Forwarding rule https-content-rule in scope global has been modified at 2024-10-18T14:34:17.798905Z.
     Target proxy https-lb-proxy in scope global has been modified at 2024-10-18T14:34:17.798905Z.

     [REMEDIATION]
     DNS validation automatically checks your domain's A and AAAA records against your Google Cloud load balancer's IP address. This process includes an automatic retry mechanism with increasing wait times. If you recently attached cert1 to a target proxy or the target proxy to forwarding rule, validation could take up to 24 hours to complete.

[END]: Finalize SSL Certificate diagnostics.

   - projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/sslCertificates/cert2               [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     DNS records for domain test.natka123.com currently resolve to the following IP addresses: 192.168.3.4. These IP addresses do not point to any load balancer associated with certificate cert2. Certificate provisioning is therefore blocked.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Configure DNS records for test.natka123.com to point to the correct load balancer IP address(es) for certificate cert2.

     The following load balancer IP addresses are associated with this certificate:

      projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/forwardingRules/https-content-rule-working 
      use IP address 2600:1901:0:d0d7:: but none of them listen on port 443. 

     There must be at least one load balancer's forwarding rule that use TCP port 443 for the Google-managed certificate to be initially provisioned and automatically renewed.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Configure the load balancer to listen on port 443 for SSL certificate "cert2".
