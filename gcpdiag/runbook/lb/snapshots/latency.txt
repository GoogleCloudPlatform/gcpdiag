lb/latency: This runbook diagnoses and troubleshoots latency issues with Application Load Balancers.

  It analyzes key metrics to identify potential bottlenecks and performance
  problems.

  Key Investigation Areas:

  - Backend Latency:
    - Measures the time taken for backends to respond to requests, checking if
    it exceeds a configurable threshold.
  - Request Count Per Second (QPS):
    - Monitors the rate of incoming requests to the load balancer, checking if
    it exceeds a configurable threshold.  A high request count coupled with high
    latency might suggest overload.
  - 5xx Error Rate:
    - Calculates the percentage of 5xx server errors, indicating problems on the
    backend servers.  This check uses a configurable threshold and considers the
    request count to provide a meaningful error rate.
  
[START]: Fetch the specified forwarding rule.
[INFO]: Forwarding rule found: https-content-rule
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check backend latency for the specified forwarding rule
[INFO]: Forwarding rule name: projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/forwardingRules/https-content-rule

   - gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/https-content-rule                                  [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The forwarding rule has a backend latency of 660138.25 ms. This is higher than the threshold value of 200 ms.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Investigate the increased backend latency. Check the health and performance of the backend instances, examining metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and disk I/O.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check request count per second for the specified forwarding rule
[INFO]: Forwarding rule name: projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/forwardingRules/https-content-rule

   - gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/https-content-rule                                  [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The forwarding rule has an average request count of 11002.3 requests/s in the last 15 minutes. This is higher than the threshold value of 150.

     [REMEDIATION]
     The high request count suggests the backend may be overloaded. Consider scaling up the backend by adding more instances or increasing the resources of existing instances.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check the 5xx error rate for the specified forwarding rule
[INFO]: Forwarding rule name: projects/gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/global/forwardingRules/https-content-rule

   - gcpdiag-lb3-aaaa/https-content-rule                                  [OK]
     [REASON]
     The forwarding rule has an average error rate of 0% in the last 15 minutes. This is less than the threshold value of 1%.

[END]: Finalize unhealthy backends diagnostics.
