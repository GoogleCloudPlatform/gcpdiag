Investigate the increased backend latency. Check the health and performance of the backend instances, examining metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and disk I/O.

{% block request_count_success_reason%}
The forwarding rule has an average request count of {average_request_count} requests/s in the last 15 minutes. This is less than the threshold value of {threshold}.

The forwarding rule has an average request count of {average_request_count} requests/s in the last 15 minutes. This is higher than the threshold value of {threshold}.

{% block request_count_failure_remediation%}
The high request count suggests the backend may be overloaded. Consider scaling up the backend by adding more instances or increasing the resources of existing instances.

The forwarding rule has an average error rate of {average_error_rate}% in the last 15 minutes. This is less than the threshold value of {threshold}%.

The forwarding rule has an average error rate of {average_error_rate}% in the last 15 minutes. This is higher than the threshold value of {threshold}%.

{% block error_rate_failure_remediation%}
A high error rate indicates potential problems with the backend service. Check the logs for 5xx errors and investigate the root cause. Common issues include application errors and resource exhaustion. If the errors correlate with specific requests, examine those requests for patterns or anomalies.
