nat/public-nat-ip-allocation-failed: Troubleshooting for IP Allocation issues for Cloud NAT.

  This runbook investigates Cloud NAT for NAT IP Allocation failed issue and proposes
  remediation steps.

  Areas Examined:

    - Metric check: Checks the NAT Allocation Failed metric for the provided NATGW if it is
    True or False.

    - NATGW Configuration: Checks the gateway if it is configured with manual or automatic IP
    allocation.

    - NAT IP and Port calculation: For source nic without an External IP address,
      verify the VM is served by a Public NAT Gateway and check there are no issues on the NATGW.
    
[START]: Starting Nat IP Allocation Failed diagnostics
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking the nat_allocation_failed metric for NAT IP allocation failure
      and the NAT router status.
    

   - gcpdiag-nat1-aaaa                                                    [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     NAT IP allocation failure found on the NAT Gateway: public-nat-gateway

     [REMEDIATION]
     Continue the runbook for further diagnostic and remediation steps for the
     IP exhaustion issue on public-nat-gateway

[GATEWAY]: Checks if the NATGW router is configured with manual or automatic IP allocation
[AUTOMATED STEP]: NAT IP allocation is configured with MANUAL_ONLY.

    Running diagnostic for NAT Gateway configured as MANUAL_ONLY only
    

   - gcpdiag-nat1-aaaa                                                    [OK]
     [REASON]
     Checking on the status and configuration of the Cloud NAT Router public-nat-cloud-router and Gateway:

     1. Minimum extra NAT IPs Needed: 2
     2. Number of VM Endpoints With NAT mappings: 2
     3. Dynamic port allocation enabled: False
     4. Number of NAT Gateway IPs in use: 1


   - gcpdiag-nat1-aaaa                                                    [OK]
     [REASON]
     The NAT Gateway public-nat-gateway is configured for manual IP allocation:

     The number of NAT IPs required is less than quota limit of 300. Consider
     taking the steps in [1] to allocate more IP address or further optimze
     port utilization on the gateway [2]
