vpc/vm-external-ip-connectivity: Troubleshooting for common issues which affect VM connectivity to external IP addresses.

  This runbook investigates components required for VMs to establish connectivity
  to external IP addresses

  Areas Examined:

  - VM Instance:
      - Verify that the VM exists and is running

  - VM Configuration:
      - Checks the source nic configuration on the VM if it has an
        External IP address or not.

  - VPC routes checks:
      - Checks the VPC routing rules are configured to allow external connectivity

  - VPC firewall and firewall policy checks:
      - Checks the VPC firewall and firewall policies allow external connectivity.

  - GCE Network Connectivity Tests:
      - Runs a VPC network connectivity test and reports the result.

  - NATGW Checks:
      - For source nics without an External IP address, verify the VM is served
        by a Public NAT Gateway and check there are no issues on the NATGW.
