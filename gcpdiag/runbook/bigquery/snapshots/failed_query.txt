bigquery/failed-query: Diagnoses issues with a failed BigQuery query job.

  This runbook investigates why a specific BigQuery job failed by verifying the
  job's status and analyzing the error message against a set of known issues to
  provide targeted remediation steps.
  
[START]: Verifying input parameters and the BigQuery API status.
[INFO]: Provided job input parameters have the correct format
[INFO]: The BigQuery API is enabled.
[GATEWAY]: Verifying permissions.
