vertex/workbench-instance-stuck-in-provisioning: Runbook to Troubleshoot Issue: Vertex AI Workbench Instance Stuck in Provisioning State

  This runbook investigates root causes for the Workbench Instance to be stuck in provisioning state

  Areas Examined:

  - Workbench Instance State: Checks the instance's current state ensuring that it is
    stuck in provisioning status and not stopped or active.

  - Workbench Instance Compute Engine VM Boot Disk Image: Checks if the instance has been created
    with a custom container, the official 'workbench-instances' images, deep learning VMs images,
    or unsupported images that might cause the instance to be stuck in provisioning state.

  - Workbench Instance Custom Scripts: Checks if the instance is not using custom scripts that may
    affect the default configuration of the instance by changing the Jupyter port or breaking
    dependencies that might cause the instance to be stuck in provisioning state.

  - Workbench Instance Environment Version: Checks if the instance is using the latest environment
    version by checking its upgradability. Old versions sometimes are the root cause for the
    instance to be stuck in provisioning state.

  - Workbench Instance Compute Engine VM Performance: Checks the VM's current performance, ensuring
    that it is not impaired by high CPU usage, insufficient memory, or disk space issues that might
    disrupt normal operations.

  - Workbench Instance Compute Engine Serial Port Logging: Checks if the instance has serial port
    logs which can be analyzed to ensure Jupyter is running on port 127.0.0.1:8080
    which is mandatory.

  - Workbench Instance Compute Engine SSH and Terminal access: Checks if the instance's
    compute engine vm is running so the user can ssh and open a terminal to check for space
    usage in 'home/jupyter'. If no space is left, that may cause the instance to be stuck
    in provisioning state.

  - Workbench Instance External IP Disabled: Checks if the external IP disabled. Wrong networking
    configurations may cause the instance to be stuck in provisioning state.

[COMPOSITE STEP]: Evaluating Workbench Instance Compute Engine VM memory, CPU, and disk performance...
[INFO]: Runbook will use ops agent metrics for VM performance investigation
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verifying VM memory utilization is within optimal levels...

   - gcpdiag-notebooks2-aaaa/notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck        [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Memory utilization on this VM has reached levels that may compromise its VM application performance.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Elevated memory usage can result in slow or unresponsive or termimated applications.
     Consider enhancing the VM's memory capacity by changing to a machine type with more memory.
     Guidance on stopping and changing the machine type can be found here:
     - Changing machine type: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance#gcloud
     For deeper analysis of memory issues:

     Additionally, use the GCE observability metrics for an in-depth analysis to pinpoint high-usage processes:
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/observe-monitor-vms#memory_utilization

     Or connect via the Serial Console if SSH is not available to mitigate the issue.
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-using-serial-console

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if VM's Boot disk space utilization is within optimal levels.

   - gcpdiag-notebooks2-aaaa/notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck        [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Disk utilization on this VM's boot disk is critically high,
     potentially affecting application performance.

     [REMEDIATION]
     To mitigate high disk usage, consider expanding the VM's boot disk capacity.
     This action can help avoid performance issues and ensure smoother SSH connections.
     Follow the guide to increase disk size:
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/resize-persistent-disk#increase_the_size_of_a_disk

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verifying VM CPU utilization is within optimal levels

   - gcpdiag-notebooks2-aaaa/notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck        [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     CPU utilization on this VM has surpassed recommended operational levels,
     which may affect its performance and SSH connectivity.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Excessive CPU usage can lead to performance bottlenecks. Consider resizing the VM to a more
     powerful machine type with higher CPU capabilities.
     Detailed instructions for resizing and restarting VMs are available here:
     - Stopping a VM: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stop-start-instance
     - Resizing a VM: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance#gcloud
     Additionally, use the GCE observability metrics for an in-depth analysis to pinpoint high-usage processes:
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/observe-monitor-vms#access_vm_observability_metrics
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/observe-monitor-vms#process_utilization

     Alternatively, you can connect via serial console if SSH is unvailable to stop offending processes
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-using-serial-console.

[GATEWAY]: Decision point to investigate Serial Port Logs

   - gcpdiag-notebooks2-aaaa/us-west1-a/notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck [OK]
     [REASON]
     OK! Workbench Instance notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck Serial Port Logging is enabled and instance is initializing.
     Checking Workbench Instance syslogs for issues...

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if Workbench Instance Jupyter is running on port 127.0.0.1:8080...
[INFO]: Jupyter is running! Verifying if it's running on port 127.0.0.1:8080...

   - gcpdiag-notebooks2-aaaa/us-west1-a/notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Workbench Instance notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck syslogs indicate Jupyter is running on a port different to 127.0.0.1:8080

     [REMEDIATION]
     If the instance is stopped, start it and rerun this check.
     You may also need to extend the logging query start and end times.
     Only port 8080 is supported. Installed extensions, packages or custom scripts may cause the port to change.

     1. Try following documentation [1] [2] [3]
     2. If it doesn't work, recover data by diagnosing the instance with the --enable-copy-home-files [4]
     3. Create a new Instance and migrate your data [5]

[COMPOSITE STEP]: Check if user is able to SSH to the Workbench Instance Compute Engine VM
[INFO]: Workbench Instance Compute Engine VM is Running!

   - gcpdiag-notebooks2-aaaa/notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck        [OK]
     [REASON]
     OK! User can SHH and open a terminal in the Workbench Instance notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck's Compute Engine VM.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check if Jupyter space in "home/jupyter" is below 85%
[INFO]: In the Workbench Instance Compute Engine VM terminal run "df". Verify "home/jupyter" used space is below 85%

   - gcpdiag-notebooks2-aaaa/notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck        [OK]
     [REASON]
     OK! Workbench Instance notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck's "/home/jupyter" space usage is below 85%

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if Workbench Instance has external IP disabled...

   - gcpdiag-notebooks2-aaaa/us-west1-a/notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     Workbench Instance notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck has external IP disabled.
     - network: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/gcpdiag-notebooks2-aaaa/global/networks/wbi-test-default
     - subnetwork: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/gcpdiag-notebooks2-aaaa/regions/us-west1/subnetworks/wbi-test-default
     This may cause networking issues if configuration was not done correctly.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Follow the public documentation to configure Private Networking for a Workbench Instance [1] [2] [3] [4]

     [1] https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/create#network-options
     [2] https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/access-apis-external-ip#requirements

[END]: Check if the instance is now in ACTIVE state
[INFO]: instance state: PROVISIONING

   - gcpdiag-notebooks2-aaaa/us-west1-a/notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Workbench Instance notebooks2instance-provisioning-stuck still in PROVISIONING, STARTING or INITIALIZING state.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Restart the instance. If the issue persists:

     1. Recover data by diagnosing the instance with the --enable-copy-home-files [1]
     2. Inspect the diagnostics output logs to find issues
     3. Create a new Instance and migrate your data [2]
