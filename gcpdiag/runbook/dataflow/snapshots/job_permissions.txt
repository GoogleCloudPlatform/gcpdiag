dataflow/job-permissions: Analysis and Resolution of Dataflow Jobs Permissions issues.

  This runbook investigates Dataflow permissions and recommends remediation steps.

  Areas Examined:
  - Dataflow User Account Permissions: Verify that individual Dataflow users have the necessary
    permissions to access and manage Dataflow jobs (e.g., create,update,cancel).

  - Dataflow Service Account Permissions: Verify that the Dataflow Service Account has the required
    permissions to execute and manage the Dataflow jobs

  - Dataflow Worker Service Account: Verify that the Dataflow Worker Service Account has the
    necessary permissions for worker instances within a Dataflow job to access input and
    output resources during job execution.

  - Dataflow Resource Permissions: Verify that Dataflow resources (e.g., Cloud Storage buckets,
    BigQuery datasets) have the necessary permissions to be accessed and used by Dataflow jobs.

  By ensuring that Dataflow resources have the necessary permissions, you
  can prevent errors and ensure that your jobs run smoothly.
  
[START]: Executing default start step for runbooks.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check the Authenticated User account permissions.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify that user:user@xyz.com has required permissions/roles in project/gcpdiag-dataflow1-aaaa.

   - projects/gcpdiag-dataflow1-aaaa                                      [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     user:user@xyz.com doesn't have at least one of the expected roles:
     roles/dataflow.developer, roles/iam.serviceAccountUser.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Follow Guide [1] to grant a role which has the correct permissions.
     [2] has a list of all Google predefined roles available to you.

     Note: You may want to doublecheck with your project admins of the best way to grant the role
     or custom roles which can be used.
