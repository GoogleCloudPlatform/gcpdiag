dataflow/job-permissions: Analysis and Resolution of Dataflow Jobs Permissions issues.

  This runbook investigates Dataflow permissions and recommends remediation steps.

  Areas Examined:
  - Dataflow User Account Permissions: Verify that individual Dataflow users have the necessary
    permissions to access and manage Dataflow jobs (e.g., create,update,cancel).

  - Dataflow Service Account Permissions: Verify that the Dataflow Service Account has the required
    permissions to execute and manage the Dataflow jobs

  - Dataflow Worker Service Account: Verify that the Dataflow Worker Service Account has the
    necessary permissions for worker instances within a Dataflow job to access input and
    output resources during job execution.

  - Dataflow Resource Permissions: Verify that Dataflow resources (e.g., Cloud Storage buckets,
    BigQuery datasets) have the necessary permissions to be accessed and used by Dataflow jobs.

  By ensuring that Dataflow resources have the necessary permissions, you
  can prevent errors and ensure that your jobs run smoothly.
  
[START]: Executing default start step for runbooks.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check the Authenticated User account permissions.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify that user:user@xyz.com has required permissions/roles in project/gcpdiag-dataflow1-aaaa.

   - projects/gcpdiag-dataflow1-aaaa                                      [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     user:user@xyz.com does not have at least one of the expected roles:
     roles/dataflow.developer, roles/iam.serviceAccountUser.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Grant a role containing the missing permissions by following the instructions in [1].
     Refer to [2] for a list of Google Cloud predefined roles.

     Note: Consider consulting with project administrators regarding the most appropriate standard or custom role to grant.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify that serviceAccount:service-12340010@dataflow-service-producer-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com has required permissions/roles in project/gcpdiag-dataflow1-aaaa.

   - projects/gcpdiag-dataflow1-aaaa                                      [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The principal `serviceAccount:service-12340010@dataflow-service-producer-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com` is missing at least one of the expected roles in the IAM policy:
     Missing roles: roles/dataflow.serviceAgent.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Grant a role that contains the required permissions. Refer to the guide [1] for details.

[GATEWAY]: Checking dataflow worker service account permissions.
[INFO]: dataflow-worker@gcpdiag-dataflow1-aaaa.iam.gserviceaccount.com

   - gcpdiag-datafusion1-aaaa                                             [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Service Account `dataflow-worker@gcpdiag-dataflow1-aaaa.iam.gserviceaccount.com` associated with the Dataflow job was not found in project `gcpdiag-dataflow1-aaaa` or the specified cross-project.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Specify the project where the service account resides using the `cross_project_project` parameter.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check the Dataflow Resource permissions.
[INFO]: No Cloud Storage buckets related errors found in the logs
[END]: Permissions checks completed.
[INFO]: Dataflow Resources Permissions Checks Completed
