Compute Engine might stop (preempt) preemptible instances if it needs to reclaim the compute capacity for allocation to other VMs.

The node {node} was removed by the cluster autoscaler.

{% block node_removed_by_autoscaler_failure_remediation %}
This is expected behavior. GKE's cluster autoscaler automatically resizes the number of nodes in a given node pool, based on the demands of your workloads. When demand is low, the cluster autoscaler scales back down to a minimum size that you designate.

{% block node_pool_upgrade_failure_reason %}
The node {node} was unavailable due to a node pool upgrade.
{% endblock node_pool_upgrade_failure_reason %}

{% block node_pool_upgrade_failure_remediation %}
This is expected behavior, when the upgrade is performed, nodes are drained and re-created to match the desired version.

To list the node upgrade operations, please issue the following gcloud command:

gcloud container operations list --filter=operationType:UPGRADE_NODES
