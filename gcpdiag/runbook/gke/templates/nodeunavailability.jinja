Compute Engine might stop (preempt) preemptible instances if it needs to reclaim the compute capacity for allocation to other VMs.

This is expected behavior. GKE's cluster autoscaler automatically resizes the number of nodes in a given node pool, based on the demands of your workloads. When demand is low, the cluster autoscaler scales back down to a minimum size that you designate.

For more details about Cluster Autoscaler ScaleDown events please consult the documentation:

{% block node_pool_upgrade_failure_reason %}
The node {node} was unavailable due to a node pool upgrade.
{% endblock node_pool_upgrade_failure_reason %}

{% block node_pool_upgrade_failure_remediation %}
This is expected behavior, when the upgrade is performed, nodes are drained and re-created to match the desired version.

To list the node upgrade operations, please issue the following gcloud command:

```
gcloud container operations list --filter=operationType:UPGRADE_NODES
```

For more details about node upgrades please consult the documentation:
