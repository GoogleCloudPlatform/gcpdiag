gke/node-auto-repair: Provides the reason why a Node was auto-repaired

  This runbook checks if:
  - Node auto-repair is enabled on the cluster
  - Nodes was repaired because it was in NotReady status for more than 10 minutes
  - Nodes was repaired because it had disk pressure
  - Nodes was repaired because of unallocatable GPUs
  - Nodes was repaired because of unallocatable TPUs
  
[START]: Check inputs and verify if there was a repair event
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if there is the node is in NotReady status.

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr                                  [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The node gke-gcp-cluster-default-pool-82e0c046-8m8b was auto-repaired because it was in a NotReady state for more than approximately 10 minutes.

     [REMEDIATION]
     The auto-repair should have fixed the detected NotReady state.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if there is the node is in NodeHasDiskPressure status.

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr                                  [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The node gke-gcp-cluster-default-pool-82e0c046-8m8b was auto-repaired because it had disk pressure for more than 30 minutes.

     [REMEDIATION]
     The auto-repair should have fixed the detected disk pressure.
     For more details check: <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-repair>

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify whether the node was auto-repaired because of Unallocatable GPUs.

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr                                  [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The node gke-gcp-cluster-default-pool-82e0c046-8m8b was auto-repaired because it had unallocatable GPU(s) for more than 15 minutes.

     [REMEDIATION]
     The auto-repair should have fixed the detected unallocatable GPU(s).
     For more details check: <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-repair>

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify whether the node was auto-repaired because of Unallocatable TPUs.

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr                                  [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The node gke-gcp-cluster-default-pool-82e0c046-8m8b was auto-repaired because it had unallocatable TPU(s) for more than 10 minutes.

     [REMEDIATION]
     The auto-repair should have fixed the detected unallocatable TPU(s).

[END]: Finalize `Node AutoRepair` diagnostics.
