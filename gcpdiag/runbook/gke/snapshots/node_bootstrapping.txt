gke/node-bootstrapping: Analyses issues experienced when adding nodes to your GKE Standard cluster.

  This runbook requires at least
  - location and node parameters. Location here is the zone where the node is
  running,
  for example us-central1-c.
  - location, nodepool and cluster name parameters to be provided. Location is
  zone or region for
  a nodepool, if the cluster is a regional cluster, then location for a nodepool
  will be the
  cluster region. For example a region could be us-central1.

  If a location/node pair is provided, the runbook will check the Node
  Registration Checker output
  for the given location/node pair.

  If a location, nodepool and GKE cluster name parameters are provided, the
  runbook will check for
  any errors that might have occurred when the instances.insert method was
  invoked for the given
  parameters.
  
[START]: Check the provided parameters.
