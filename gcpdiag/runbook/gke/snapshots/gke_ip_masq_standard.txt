gke/gke-ip-masq-standard: This runbook will analyze symptoms for IP Masquerading issues on GKE Cluster.

  It examines the following:

  - Are there any traffic logs to destination IP?
  - Is ip-masq-agent DaemonSet in kube-system namespace?
  - Is ip-masq-agent Configmap in kube-system namespace?
  - Is GKE node IP and Pod IP are under nonMasquerade CIDR?
  - Is Destination IP is under are under nonMasquerade CIDR?
  
[START]: Lets check the provided parameters.

   - gcpdiag-gke4-aaaa                                                    [OK]
     [REASON]
     Cluster with name gke1 exist in project gcpdiag-gke4-runbook
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Are you seeing issue from GKE NODE as well?

   - gcpdiag-gke4-aaaa                                                    [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     There are no egress traffic to Destination IP which indicates that GKE NODE is also having issue to connect to
     destination IP.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Enable VPC flow logs by following the documentation and look if traffic id going out to destination:
     <https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-flow-logs#enable-logging-existing>

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Lets check if Daemon set present..

   - gcpdiag-gke4-aaaa                                                    [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     Check for ip-masq-agent daemonSet is deployed in the Cluster. If yes follow check next step.

     [REMEDIATION]
     If No, please follow [1] to deploy ip-masq-agent DaemonSet in the kube-system namespace and wait for around 5 minutes
     for the DaemonSet to be ready.

     [1] <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#checking_the_ip-masq-agent_daemonset>

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Lets confirm if config map is configure.

   - gcpdiag-gke4-aaaa                                                    [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     When ip-masq-agent daemonset is deployed without a configmap, it uses the default non-masq destinations [1].

     [1] <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#creating_the_ip-masq-agent_configmap>

     [REMEDIATION]
     If you needs to customize the configmap, then follow the steps [1] to deploy ip-masq-agent ConfigMap in the kube-system
     namespace.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Lets check pod ip present..

   - gcpdiag-gke4-aaaa                                                    [UNCERTAIN]

     [REMEDIATION]
     Follow the steps for including the pod IP CIDRs in nonMasqueradeCIDRs [1].

     [1] <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#edit-ip-masq-agent-configmap>

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Lets check node IP is present under non-masq cidr.

   - gcpdiag-gke4-aaaa                                                    [UNCERTAIN]

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Lets check if pod ip address is present.
