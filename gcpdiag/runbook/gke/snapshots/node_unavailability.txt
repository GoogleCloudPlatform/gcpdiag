gke/node-unavailability: Identifies the reasons for a GKE node being unavailable.

  This runbook investigates various factors that may have caused a node to become unavailable,
  including:

  - Live Migration
  - Preemption
  - Removal by the Cluster Autoscaler
  - Node Pool Upgrade
  
[START]: Check inputs and verify if the node was unavailable
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check for live migration logs.

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr                                  [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Live migration check failed for node gke-gcp-cluster-default-pool-82e0c046-8m8b.

     [REMEDIATION]
     There was a live migration event for the node gke-gcp-cluster-default-pool-82e0c046-8m8b.

     For more details about Live migration process during maintenance events, please consult the documentation:
     <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/live-migration-process>

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checks for preemption logs.

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr                                  [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The node gke-gcp-cluster-default-pool-82e0c046-8m8b was preempted.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Compute Engine might stop (preempt) preemptible instances if it needs to reclaim the compute capacity for allocation to other VMs.

     For more details about preemptible VMs in GKE please consult the documentation:
     <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/preemptible-vms>

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checks for Cluster Autoscaler ScaleDown logs.

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr                                  [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The node gke-gcp-cluster-default-pool-82e0c046-8m8b was removed by the cluster autoscaler.

     [REMEDIATION]
     This is expected behavior. GKE's cluster autoscaler automatically resizes the number of nodes in a given node pool, based on the demands of your workloads. When demand is low, the cluster autoscaler scales back down to a minimum size that you designate.

     For more details about Cluster Autoscaler ScaleDown events please consult the documentation:
     <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-autoscaler-visibility#scaledown-event>

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checks for Node Upgrade operation logs.

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr                                  [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The node gke-gcp-cluster-default-pool-82e0c046-8m8b was unavailable due to a node pool upgrade.

     [REMEDIATION]
     This is expected behavior, when the upgrade is performed, nodes are drained and re-created to match the desired version.

     To list the node upgrade operations, please issue the following gcloud command:

     ```
     gcloud container operations list --filter=operationType:UPGRADE_NODES
     ```

     For more details about node upgrades please consult the documentation:
     <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-upgrades>

[END]: Finalize `Node Unavailability` diagnostics.
