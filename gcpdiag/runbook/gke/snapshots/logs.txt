gke/logs: Provides a methodical approach to troubleshooting GKE logging issues.

  This runbook guides you through a systematic investigation of potential
  causes when logs from the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster are missing
  or incomplete. The focus is on core configuration settings that are essential
  for proper logging functionality.

  The following areas are examined:

  - **Project-Level Logging:** Ensures that the Google Cloud project housing
  the GKE cluster has the Cloud Logging API enabled.

  - **Cluster-Level Logging:** Verifies that logging is explicitly enabled
  within the GKE cluster's configuration.

  - **Node Pool Permissions:** Confirms that the nodes within the cluster's
  node pools have the 'Cloud Logging Write' scope enabled, allowing them to send
  log data.

  - **Service Account Permissions:** Validates that the service account used
  by the node pools possesses the necessary IAM permissions to interact with
  Cloud Logging. Specifically, the "roles/logging.logWriter" role is typically
  required.

  - **Cloud Logging API Write Quotas:** Verifies that Cloud Logging API Write
  quotas have not been exceeded within the specified timeframe.
  
[START]: Checks the provided parameters.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checks if logging API is disabled in the project.

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr                                  [OK]
     [REASON]
     The logging API is enabled in your project.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checks if GKE level logging is disabled

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr/europe-west10/gcp-cluster        [OK]
     [REASON]
      GKE level logging is enabled for the cluster projects/gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr/locations/europe-west10/clusters/gcp-cluster.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verifies the node pools have Cloud Logging access scope

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr/europe-west10/gcp-cluster/default-pool [OK]
     [REASON]
     The node pool projects/gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr/locations/europe-west10/clusters/gcp-cluster/nodePools/default-pool has the correct Cloud Logging access scope.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verifies the node pool's service account has a role with the correct logging IAM permissions

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr/europe-west10/gcp-cluster/default-pool [OK]
     [REASON]
     Service account: 1234000173-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com has the correct logging permissions.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checks if Cloud Logging API write quotas have been exceeded

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr                                  [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Project gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr has recently exceeded the following quotas: WriteRequestsPerMinutePerProject.
     [REMEDIATION]
     Please check the project gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr for the Cloud Logging API quotas WriteRequestsPerMinutePerProject which have been reached
[END]: Finalize `GKE logs` diagnostics.
