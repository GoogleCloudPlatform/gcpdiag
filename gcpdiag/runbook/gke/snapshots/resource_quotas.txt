gke/resource-quotas: Analyses logs in the project where the cluster is running.

  If there are log entries that contain messages listed in the public documentation
  https://cloud.google.com/knowledge/kb/google-kubernetes-engine-pods-fail-to-start-due-to-exceeded-quota-000004701
  then provide details on how this issue can be solved.
  
[START]: Check the provided parameters.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify logging.googleapis.com API is ENABLED in project gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr.

   - gcpdiag-gke-cluster-autoscaler-rrrr                                  [OK]
     [REASON]
     The `logging.googleapis.com` service is currently in the expected state: `ENABLED`.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify cluster's running version. GKE doesn't enforce the Kubernetes resource quotas for clusters running version 1.28 or later.
[END]: Finalize `Resource Quotas` diagnostics.
