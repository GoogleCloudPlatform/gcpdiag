dataproc/cluster-creation: Provides a comprehensive analysis of common issues which affect Dataproc cluster creation.

  This runbook focuses on a range of potential problems for Dataproc clusters on
  Google Cloud Platform. By conducting a series of checks, the runbook aims to
  pinpoint the root cause of cluster creation difficulties.

  The following areas are examined:

  - Stockout errors: Evaluates Logs Explorer logs regarding stockout in the
  region/zone.

  - Quota availability: Checks for the quota availability in Dataproc cluster project.

  - Network configuration: Performs GCE Network Connectivity Tests, checks necessary firewall rules, external/internal IP configuration.

  - Cross-project configuration: Checks if the service account is not in the same
  project and reviews additional
    roles and organization policies enforcement.

  - Shared VPC configuration: Checks if the Dataproc cluster uses a Shared VPC network and
  evaluates if right service account roles are added.

  - Init actions script failures: Evaluates Logs Explorer
  logs regarding init actions script failures or timeouts.
  
[START]: Verify cluster quota.

     the right cluster_name parameter if the cluster you are trying to create doesn't appear in Dataproc UI.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify cluster stockout issue.

[GATEWAY]: Verify cluster is in ERROR state.
[INFO]: Cluster is in RUNNING state. Please choose another issue category to investigate, the issue is not related to cluster creation, as the cluster provisioned successfully.
[END]: This is the end step of the runbook.
[INFO]: Please visit all the FAIL steps and address the suggested remediations.
        If the cluster is still not able to be provisioned successfully,
        run the runbook again and open a Support case. If you are missing
        Service Account permissions, but are not able to see the Service Agent
        Service Account go to the IAM page and check 'Include Google-provided
        role grants'
