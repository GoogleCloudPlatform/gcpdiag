dataproc/cluster-creation: Provides a comprehensive analysis of common issues which affect Dataproc cluster creation.

  This runbook focuses on a range of potential problems for Dataproc clusters on
  Google Cloud Platform. By conducting a series of checks, the runbook aims to
  pinpoint the root cause of cluster creation difficulties.

  The following areas are examined:

  - Stockout errors: Evaluates Logs Explorer logs regarding stockout in the
  region/zone.

  - Quota availability: Checks for the quota availability in Dataproc cluster project.

  - Network configuration: Performs GCE Network Connectivity Tests, checks necessary firewall rules, external/internal IP configuration.

  - Cross-project configuration: Checks if the service account is not in the same
  project and reviews additional
    roles and organization policies enforcement.

  - Shared VPC configuration: Checks if the Dataproc cluster uses a Shared VPC network and
  evaluates if right service account roles are added.

  - Init actions script failures: Evaluates Logs Explorer
  logs regarding init actions script failures or timeouts.
  
[START]: Verify cluster quota...

     [REASON]
     The cluster good in project gcpdiag-dataproc1-aaaa could not be created due to insufficient quota in the project.

     [REMEDIATION]
     This issue occurs when the requested Dataproc cluster exceeds the project's available quota for resources such as CPU, disk space, or IP addresses.
     Solution: Request additional quota [1] from the Google Cloud console or use another project.

     [REASON]
     The cluster good creation in project gcpdiag-dataproc1-aaaa failed due to insufficient resources in the selected zone/region.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Dataproc cluster stockout occurs when there are insufficient resources available in a specific zone or region to create your requested cluster.
     Solutions to resolve the issue include:
     - Create the cluster in a different zone or region.
     - Use the Dataproc Auto Zone placement feature by not specifying the zone [1].

     [REASON]
     The cluster test-deny-icmp creation failed because the initialization script encountered an error.

     [REMEDIATION]
     A Dataproc cluster init script failure means that a script intended to run during the cluster's initial setup did not complete successfully.
     Solution:
     See initialization actions considerations and guidelines [1].
     Examine the output logs. The error message should provide a link to the logs in Cloud Storage.
