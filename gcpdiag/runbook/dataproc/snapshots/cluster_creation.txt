dataproc/cluster-creation: Provides a comprehensive analysis of common issues which affect Dataproc cluster creation.

  This runbook focuses on a range of potential problems for Dataproc clusters on
  Google Cloud Platform. By conducting a series of checks, the runbook aims to
  pinpoint the root cause of cluster creation difficulties.

  The following areas are examined:

  - Stockout errors: Evaluates Logs Explorer logs regarding stockout in the
  region/zone.

  - Quota availability: Checks for the quota availability in Dataproc cluster
  project.

  - Network configuration: Performs GCE Network Connectivity Tests, checks
  necessary firewall rules, external/internal IP configuration.

  - Cross-project configuration: Checks if the service account is not in the
  same
  project and reviews additional
    roles and organization policies enforcement.

  - Shared VPC configuration: Checks if the Dataproc cluster uses a Shared VPC
  network and
  evaluates if right service account roles are added.

  - Init actions script failures: Evaluates Logs Explorer
  logs regarding init actions script failures or timeouts.

     [REASON]
     The cluster cluster-stockout-issues creation in project gcpdiag-dataproc3-aaaa failed due to insufficient resources in the selected zone/region.

     [REMEDIATION]
     A Dataproc cluster creation stockout occurs when the requested resources for cluster creation are currently not available within a specified Google Cloud zone or region.

     Resolution Steps:

     1. Utilize Dataproc Auto Zone Placement: When creating your Dataproc cluster, avoid explicitly specifying a zone. Instead, leverage Dataproc's Auto Zone placement feature, which automatically selects an available zone with sufficient resources. <https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/auto-zone>
     2. Review Capacity and Quota Management: If you are already employing Auto Zone placement and still encountering stockouts, it may indicate broader capacity or quota limitations. Consult the following resource for comprehensive strategies on managing capacity, quotas, and stockouts in Google Cloud.<https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Community-Blogs/Managing-Capacity-Quota-and-Stockouts-in-the-Cloud-Concepts-and/ba-p/464770>
