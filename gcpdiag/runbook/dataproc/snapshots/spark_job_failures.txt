dataproc/spark-job-failures: Provides a comprehensive analysis of common issues which affects Dataproc Spark job failures.

  This runbook focuses on a range of potential problems for Dataproc Spark jobs
  on
  Google Cloud Platform. By conducting a series of checks, the runbook aims to
  pinpoint the root cause of Spark job failures.

  The following areas are examined:

  - Cluster version supportability: Evaluates if the job was run on a supported
  cluster image version.
  - Permissions: Checks for permission related issues on the cluster and GCS
  bucket level.
  - OOM: Checks Out-Of-Memory issues for the Spark job on master or worker
  nodes.
  - Logs: Check other logs related to shuffle failures, broken pipe, YARN
  runtime exception, import failures.
  - Throttling: Checks if the job was throttled and provides the exact reason
  for it.
  - GCS Connector: Evaluates possible issues with the GCS Connector.
  - BigQuery Connector: Evaluates possible issues with BigQuery Connector, such
  as dependency version conflicts.
