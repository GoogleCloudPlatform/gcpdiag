Could not determine if the `dataproc:dataproc.logging.stackdriver.enable` property is enabled for cluster, possibly because the cluster was deleted. Subsequent checks requiring Cloud logging might be affected.

Enable Cloud logging by creating a cluster with property dataproc:dataproc.logging.stackdriver.enable = true.

No user-specified Cloud Storage connector version was identified. The cluster is using the default version.

{% block gcs_connector_uncertain_reason %}
A user-specified Cloud Storage connector version was identified for cluster. Using a non-default connector version can lead to issues if not required by the application, as Dataproc clusters include a default pre-installed GCS connector.

The cluster uses image version {image_version} which preinstalls the BigQuery connector, and no conflicting BigQuery JARs were provided. Dependency version conflicts on the BigQuery side are not expected.

{% block bq_connector_uncertain_reason %}
The cluster uses image version {image_version} which preinstalls the BigQuery connector, and a different version of the BigQuery connector is being installed at the cluster or job level. This might cause dependency version conflicts and lead to job failures.
{% endblock bq_connector_uncertain_reason %}

{% block bq_connector_uncertain_remediation %}
Resolve potential BigQuery connector version conflicts using one of the following approaches:

- If providing the BigQuery JAR at the cluster level: Create the Dataproc cluster without specifying any BigQuery JAR.
- If providing the BigQuery JAR at the job level: Run the job without specifying any BigQuery JAR.
- If installing a BigQuery JAR is necessary: Match the version of the BigQuery JAR to the version preinstalled on the cluster (version {bq_version} for image {image_version}).
