1. Manually investigate by accessing the Guest OS to Analyze Memory Usage:
* Identify processes with consistently high memory consumption:
- Run `top` and press "M" to sort processes by memory usage.
- Alternatively, use the command:
```bash
ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head -n 5
```
* Focus on processes with recent spikes or consistently high memory usage.
* If SSH access is unavailable, consider [troubleshooting via the serial
console](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-using-serial-console).

2. Review Application or Configuration Changes:
* Investigate if recent deployments, updates, or configuration changes correlate with increased memory usage.

3. Resolve Identified Bottlenecks:
* For applications causing excessive memory usage:
- Optimize their configuration or update them to a stable version.
- Explore alternatives if optimization is insufficient.
* Evaluate scaling up resources if the high memory usage results from legitimate application demands.

4. Increase Instance Memory if Necessary:
* If additional memory is required for the application:
- Stop the VM and [change its machine
type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance#gcloud).
- Consult the [machine type documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) to select an appropriate
configuration.

There can be multiple reasons which can cause Slow Disk IOs:

- CPU Starvation - Small instances(with lesser CPUs) may not have enough CPU to serve all I/Os inflight.
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance#cpu_and_memory_performance

- Network Throttling - High sent/received network traffic can cause network throttling that impacts disk operations.
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance#network_performance

- Insufficient Machine Resources - If your machine's IOPS and throughput limits are not enough to serve your workloads,
this can also cause CPU or Disk IOPS/throughput Starvation.
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance#storage_performance

- Application and GuestOS Operations - Unmanaged and untested application workloads can cause the high influx of IOs
to the disk and cause IO operations to be queued, causing throttling at disk and CPU levels.

- Please optimize your application workloads.
- If needed, please add more resources(CPU, Memory) to the VM.

{% block disk_io_latency_check_failure_remediation %}
Disk I/O latency is the time it takes for a read or write operation to complete on a
disk.
High disk I/O latency can significantly impact the performance of your applications
and workloads running on the instance, leading to slow response times, increased
processing time, and overall sluggishness.

Potential Bottlenecks -
- Disk Type: To optimize disk performance, ensure your disk type is appropriate
for your workload and provides acceptable latency for your system architecture.
Choosing the right disk type can significantly impact performance.
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks

- Workload: The nature of your workload also influences latency. Workloads with
many small, random I/O operations will generally have higher latency than those
with sequential I/O

Optimize Disk Usage:
- Reduce I/O Operations: Optimize your applications and database queries to minimize
the number of disk I/O operations.
- Increase I/O Request Size: Larger I/O requests can be more efficient than many small
ones. Consider adjusting your application or database settings to increase the I/O
request size.
- Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the need to access the disk for
frequently used data.

Choose the Right Disk Type with lesser IO Latency - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks
