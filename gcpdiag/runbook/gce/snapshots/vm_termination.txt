gce/vm-termination: GCE Instance unexpected shutdowns and reboots diagnostics

  This runbook assists in investigating and understanding the reasons behind unexpected
  terminations or reboots of GCE Virtual Machines (VMs).

  Areas investigated:

  - System event-triggered shutdowns and reboots: Identifies terminations initiated by Google Cloud
    systems due to maintenance events, hardware failures, or resource constraints.

  - Admin activities-triggered shutdown/reboot: Investigates terminations caused by direct actions,
    such as API calls made by users or service accounts, including manual shutdowns, restarts, or
    automated processes impacting VM states.
  
[START]: Validate the provided parameters to investigate VM terminations.
[GATEWAY]: Investigate VM termination reason.
[GATEWAY]: Decision point to investigate various stop operation types
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Investigate the scheduled stop policy
[END]: Finalize VM terminations diagnostics.

   - gcpdiag-gce5-aaaa/shielded-vm-integrity-failure                      [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Instance projects/gcpdiag-gce5-aaaa/zones/us-central1-c/instances/shielded-vm-integrity-failure was terminated by account service-123456012345@compute-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com due to a scheduled stop policy.

     [REMEDIATION]
     No action required. VM is currently running.

[END]: Finalize VM terminations diagnostics.
