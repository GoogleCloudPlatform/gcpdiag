gce/vm-termination: GCE Instance shutdowns and reboots Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

  This runbook is designed to assist you in investigating and understanding the underlying reasons
  behind the unexpected termination or reboot of your GCE Virtual Machines (VMs) within Google
  Cloud Platform.

  Key Investigation Areas:

  System Event-Triggered Shutdowns/Reboots: Identifies terminations initiated by internal Google
  Cloud systems due to system maintenance events, normal hardware failures,
  resource constraints.

  System Admin Activities-Triggered Shutdowns/Reboots: Investigates terminations caused by
  direct actions, such as API calls made by users or service accounts. These actions
  may include manual shutdowns, restarts, or automated processes impacting VM states.

  RCA Text Generation: Provides a detailed Root Cause Analysis text, outlining the identified
  cause of termination, the involved systems or activities, and recommendations
  to prevent future occurrences where applicable.
  
[START]: Starting VM Termination diagnostics
[GATEWAY]: Determining whether to investigate one or more terminations
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Investigating VM termination reason.
[INFO]: 

No GCE Instance was terminated between {start_time} and {end_time}

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify that the terminated VM is currently running

   - gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook/faulty-linux-ssh                       [OK]
     [REASON]
     The terminated VM is currently up and running indicating proper functionality.

[END]: Finalize VM terminations diagnostics.

     [REASON]
     The terminated VM is still shutdown. You can turn it on if there are no other concerns.

     [REMEDIATION]
     This step failed because GCE Virtual Machine faulty-windows-ssh is expected to be in a RUNNING state:

     To initiate the lifecycle transition from TERMINATED to RUNNING state follow guide [1]

     If you encounter any difficulties during the startup process, consult the troubleshooting
     documentation to identify and resolve potential startup issues [2]
