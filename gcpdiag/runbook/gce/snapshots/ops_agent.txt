gce/ops-agent: Investigates the necessary GCP components for the proper functioning of the Ops Agent in a VM

  This runbook will examine the following key areas:

  1. API Service Checks:
    - Ensures that Cloud APIs for Logging and/or Monitoring are accessible.

  2. Permission Checks:
    - Verifies that the necessary permissions are in place for exporting logs and/or metrics.

  3. Workload Authentication:
    - Confirms that the Ops Agent has a service account for authentication.
    - If using Google Application Credentials, provide the service account
      with the `gac_service_account` parameter.

  4. Scope of Investigation:
    - Note that this runbook does not include internal VM checks, such as guest OS investigations.
