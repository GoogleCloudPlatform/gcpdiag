     [REASON]
     Unable to investigate the high memory utilization error logs, likely due to the absence of logs.
     However, this does not eliminate the possibility of high memory usage.

     You may manually verify memory utilization on the Guest OS side a likely cause.

     [REMEDIATION]
     1. Manually investigate by accessing the Guest OS to Analyze Memory Usage:
     * Identify processes with consistently high memory consumption:
     - Run `top` and press "M" to sort processes by memory usage.
     - Alternatively, use the command:
     ```bash
     ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head -n 5
     ```
     * Focus on processes with recent spikes or consistently high memory usage.
     * If SSH access is unavailable, consider [troubleshooting via the serial
     console](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-using-serial-console).

     2. Review Application or Configuration Changes:
     * Investigate if recent deployments, updates, or configuration changes correlate with increased memory usage.

     3. Resolve Identified Bottlenecks:
     * For applications causing excessive memory usage:
     - Optimize their configuration or update them to a stable version.
     - Explore alternatives if optimization is insufficient.
     * Evaluate scaling up resources if the high memory usage results from legitimate application demands.

     4. Increase Instance Memory if Necessary:
     * If additional memory is required for the application:
     - Stop the VM and [change its machine
     type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance#gcloud).
     - Consult the [machine type documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) to select an appropriate
     configuration.

  Investigates components required for ssh on either Windows and Linux VMs
  hosted on Google Cloud Platform and pinpoint misconfigurations.

  Areas Examined:

  - VM Instance Status: Evaluates the VM's current state, performance - ensuring that it is running
    and not impaired by high CPU usage, insufficient memory, or disk space issues that might disrupt
    normal SSH operations.

  - User Permissions: Checks for the necessary Google Cloud IAM permissions that are required to
    leverage OS Login features and to use metadata-based SSH keys for authentication.

  - VM Configuration: Analyzes the VM's metadata settings to confirm the inclusion of SSH keys,
    flags and other essential configuration details that facilitate SSH access.

  - GCE Network Connectivity Tests: Reviews applicable firewall rules to verify that there are no
    network barriers preventing SSH access to the VM.

  - Internal Guest OS Checks: Analysis available Guest OS metrics or logs to detect any
    misconfigurations or service disruptions that could be obstructing SSH functionality.

  - SSH in Browser Checks: Checks if the authenticated user has relevant permissions and
    the organization policies permits SSH in Browser.

   - gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook/faulty-windows-ssh                     [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The GCE Instance projects/gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook/zones/europe-west2-a/instances/faulty-windows-ssh is in TERMINATED state.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Restart VM projects/gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook/zones/europe-west2-a/instances/faulty-windows-ssh and ensure VM lifecycle transitions from TERMINATED to RUNNING.

     You can [restart a compute instance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stop-start-instance#restart-vm)
     with this guide.

     If you encounter any difficulties starting the VM, consult the [VM Startup troubleshooting
     documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/vm-startup#identify_the_reason_why_the_boot_disk_isnt_booting)
     to identify and resolve potential startup issues.

[COMPOSITE STEP]: Evaluating VM memory, CPU, and disk performance.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify VM memory utilization is within optimal levels.

   - gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook/faulty-windows-ssh                     [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Memory utilization on this VM has reached levels that may compromise its VM application performance.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Elevated memory usage can result in slow or unresponsive or termimated applications.
     Consider enhancing the VM's memory capacity by changing to a machine type with more memory.
     Guidance on stopping and changing the machine type can be found here:
     - Changing machine type:
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance#gcloud
     For deeper analysis of memory issues:

     Additionally, use the Compute Engine observability metrics for an in-depth analysis to pinpoint high-usage processes:
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/observe-monitor-vms#memory_utilization

     Or connect via the Serial Console if SSH is not available to mitigate the issue.
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-using-serial-console

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check for memory related errors in VM serial logs.

   - gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook/faulty-windows-ssh                     [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     Unable to investigate the high memory utilization error logs, likely due to the absence of logs.
     However, this does not eliminate the possibility of high memory usage.

     You may manually verify memory utilization on the Guest OS side a likely cause.

     [REMEDIATION]
     1. Manually investigate by accessing the Guest OS to Analyze Memory Usage:
     * Identify processes with consistently high memory consumption:
     - Run `top` and press "M" to sort processes by memory usage.
     - Alternatively, use the command:
     ```bash
     ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head -n 5
     ```
     * Focus on processes with recent spikes or consistently high memory usage.
     * If SSH access is unavailable, consider [troubleshooting via the serial
     console](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-using-serial-console).

     2. Review Application or Configuration Changes:
     * Investigate if recent deployments, updates, or configuration changes correlate with increased memory usage.

     3. Resolve Identified Bottlenecks:
     * For applications causing excessive memory usage:
     - Optimize their configuration or update them to a stable version.
     - Explore alternatives if optimization is insufficient.
     * Evaluate scaling up resources if the high memory usage results from legitimate application demands.

     4. Increase Instance Memory if Necessary:
     * If additional memory is required for the application:
     - Stop the VM and [change its machine
     type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance#gcloud).
     - Consult the [machine type documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) to select an appropriate
     configuration.

     **Note:**
     Non Google provided Application-specific issues may fall outside support scope. Collaborate with
     relevant application teams for further investigation.
     Refer to the [Google Cloud Platform support
     policy](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/support-maintenance-policy#support-scope)
     for details, including [out-of-scope
     items](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/support-maintenance-policy#out-of-scope_for_support).
