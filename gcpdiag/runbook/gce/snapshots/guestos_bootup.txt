gce/guestos-bootup:  Google Compute Engine VM Guest OS boot-up runbook.

    This runbook is designed to investigate the various boot-up stages of a Linux or Windows Guest
    OS running on Google Compute Engine. It is intended to help you identify and troubleshoot issues
    that may arise during the boot process. The runbook provides a structured approach to resolve
    issues.

    Key Investigation Areas:

    Boot Issues:
        - Check for Boot issues happening due to Kernel panics
        - Check for GRUB related issues.
        - Check if system failed to find boot disk.
        - Check if Filesystem corruption is causing issues with system boot.
        - Check if "/" Filesystem consumption is causing issues with system boot.

    Cloud-init checks:
        - Check if cloud-init has initialised or started.
        - Check if NIC has received the IP.

    Network related issues:
        - Check if metadata server became unreachable since last boot.
        - Check if there are any time sync related errors.

    Google Guest Agent checks:
        - Check if there are logs related to successful startup of Google Guest Agent.
  
[START]: Verify GCE Instance is in a "RUNNING" state.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Examine Guest OS if there are any indications of kernel panic.

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Detected kernel panic logs in projects/gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook/zones/europe-west2-a/instances/faulty-linux-ssh serial logs,
     which is likely preventing the VM from booting up correctly.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Kernel panics can be caused by different issues within the guest.
     Address underlying issues causing boot problems to solve the kernel panic:

     **General Kernel panic Troubleshooting**

     1. Consult the Troubleshooting Guide for Kernel Panic Errors:
        - Kernel panic is commonly caused by file system errors in Linux Guest OS.
        - Check `/etc/fstab` for incorrect entries that could halt the boot process.
        - Refer to this guide for resolving [kernel panic issues caused by
     /etc/fstab](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/fstab-errors).

     2. Resources for Kernel panic
        - [Troubleshooting GCE Instance experiencing Kernel
     Panic](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/kernel-panic#resolve_the_kernel_panic_error)
        - [Common Red Hat Kernel Panic
     Issues](https://access.redhat.com/search/knowledgebase?q=kernel+panic&p=1&rows=10&documentKind=Solution%26Documentation&sort=relevant)
        - [Common SUSE Kernel Panic Issues](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/?id=&q=kernel+panic&bu_suse=true&advanced=false)

     3. Rescue an instance experiencing kernel panic

     recover faulty VMs.

     [Understand GCP support for kernel-related
     issues](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/support-maintenance-policy#support-scope).

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verify any Filesystem corruption related errors in Serial console logs

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Possible filesystem corruption detected.

     The patterns used:

     ```
     'Corruption of in-memory data detected. Shutting down filesystem',
     'Corruption of in-memory data detected', 'warning: mounting fs with errors',
     'Failed to mount /',
     'A stop job is running for Security \.\.\..* Service ',
     'I/O Error Detected. Shutting down filesystem',
     'metadata I/O error in'
     ```


     [REMEDIATION]
     To resolve filesystem corruption, admins can use [gce-rescue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gce-rescue),
     available in Cloud Shell, to rescue faulty VMs. Alternatively, you can follow the
     [manual method](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/rescue-vm) to repair the filesystem.

     Additional resources for reference:

     - [Red Hat article on filesystem repair](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1750923)
     - [Video guide on rescuing VMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD6IFpjEtEw)

     These resources provide detailed steps for diagnosing and resolving filesystem issues.

[COMPOSITE STEP]: Cloud init related checks

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [SKIP]
     [REASON]
     This VM is not Ubuntu or it does not uses cloud-init
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Check for metadata network connectivity errors

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The metadata server(169.254.169.254) is unreachable from the GCE Instance.
     The instance might not have IP assigned to its primary NIC.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Attempt to log in to the instance via the serial console using a password and check the status of the network stack.

     If login via the serial console is unsuccessful, consider restarting the instance.

     If the issue persists after a reboot, follow the [rescue VM
     guide](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/rescue-vm) for further troubleshooting.

     Additionally, refer to the [troubleshooting metadata server
     guide](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-metadata-server) to address potential issues
     with the Compute Engine metadata server.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking for Guest Agent startup logs

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [OK]
     [REASON]
     Detected that Google Guest Agent is running within the VM
