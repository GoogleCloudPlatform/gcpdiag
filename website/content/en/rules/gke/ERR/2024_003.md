  GKE nodes service account permissions fit container.defaultNodeServiceAccount role
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

The service account used by GKE nodes should posess the permissions of the container.defaultNodeServiceAccount role,
otherwise ingestion of logs or metrics won't work.

### Remediation

Make sure your GKE node pool service accounts have the following role binding in the IAM policy

- Principal: GKE node pool service account
- Role: `container.defaultNodeServiceAccount`

or use a custom role which
contains [those permissions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#container.defaultNodeServiceAccount)
