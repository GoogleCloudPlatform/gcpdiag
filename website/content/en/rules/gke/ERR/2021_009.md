  Version skew between cluster and node pool
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description


Difference between cluster version and node pools version should be no more
than 2 minor versions.

For example: Cluster 1.19.12-gke.2101, Node Pool: 1.14.10-gke.36
Such a big difference is not supported.

In this situation the cluster might be stuck in auto-repair.
Possible solution is to upgrade the problematic node pool or recreate it
with a later version.
