  GKE clusters should have NodeLocal DNSCache enabled for better DNS performance.
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Networking](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

NodeLocal DNSCache improves DNS reliability and performance within the cluster by running a local DNS cache on each node. This reduces latency and load on kube-dns. It is a recommended best practice for most Standard clusters. Autopilot clusters have this enabled by default.

### Remediation
Enable NodeLocal DNSCache on an existing Standard cluster using the following `gcloud` command:

```
gcloud container clusters update ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
    --location=${COMPUTE_LOCATION} \
    --update-addons=NodeLocalDNS=ENABLED
```
Replace ${CLUSTER_NAME} and ${COMPUTE_LOCATION} (e.g., us-central1 for region) with your cluster's details.
