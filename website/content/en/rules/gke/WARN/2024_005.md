 GKE Ingress successfully routes external traffic to the service, accessible via a NodePort
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

For Ingress to work without container-native load balancing,
the backend Service must be of type NodePort.

Error Seen in Cloud logging/UI: Translation failed: invalid ingress spec:
service "default/whereami" is type "ClusterIP", expected "NodePort" or
"LoadBalancer"

### Remediation

In the Service manifest, you must use type: NodePort unless you're using
container native load balancing. If using container native load balancing,
use the type: ClusterIP.
