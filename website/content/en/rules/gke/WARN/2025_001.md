 GKE External LoadBalancer service fails with subnet configured with ipv6 internal access only
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

GKE cluster in a dual-stack subnet with internal IPs allocated for internal
load balancers and external IPs for external access.

If you're using a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster with a
dual-stack subnet configured for internal IPv6 access, you won't be
able to create or update an external load balancer service. External
load balancers need an external IP address. This address is normally
taken from the GKE subnet. Internal IPv6 access prevents external IP
allocation. When your subnet is set up for internal IPv6 access, the
system prioritizes internal IPs, making it impossible to get an external
IPv6 address for the load balancer. This limitation applies to services
without the annotation "networking.gke.io/load-balancer-type: "Internal"
which specifically instructs GKE to create an external load balancer

### Remediation

Create a separate subnet within your VPC specifically for external resources and services
Configure this subnet with external IPv6 access only. This ensures that external IPv6
addresses are available for your external load balancer
When creating your GKE cluster, specify this new subnet for your nodes and external services
