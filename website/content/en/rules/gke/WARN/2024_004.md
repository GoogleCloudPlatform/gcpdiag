 Ingress creation is successful if Backendconfig crd is correctly mapped
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Any custom settings defined in the BackendConfig (like timeouts, health checks, etc.)
will no longer apply to the Ingress.
Error Seen in Cloud logging/UI: "Translation failed: invalid ingress spec: error getting BackendConfig
for port"

### Remediation

If the BackendConfig linked to your GKE Ingress is deleted, you'll need to recreate it
(either from a backup or by configuring it anew). Then, update your Ingress resource to reference this new BackendConfig.
