  Cloud Composer Dags are not getting timed out by the Dag Processor
---

**Product**: [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

Sometimes we can see dag processor logs with task time out error. "Processor
for/home/airflow/gcs/dags/exampledagname.py with PID 12345678 started at
<DataTime>has timed out, killing it." In an ideal composer environment this
error shouldnot occur as it is a cause of scheduler resource constraint and
complex DAGparsing implementation.

### Remediation
Use the dag code [best practices](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/best-practices.html#top-level-python-code) so that parse time get improved.
Make sure scheduler is working at its best in terms of the resources.
You may start reducing the schdeuler's work by increasing the [min_file_process_interval](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#min-file-process-interval)
[This page](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/troubleshooting-dags#dag-processor) will help to mask the issue by increasing the parsing timeout value, but it will not prevent the issue. Please follow the above points to identify and fix the DAG parsing issue.
