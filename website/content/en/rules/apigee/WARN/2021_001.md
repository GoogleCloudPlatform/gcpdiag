**Product**: [Apigee API Management](https://cloud.google.com/apigee)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Every environment group contains at least one environment.

An environment must be a member of at least one environment group before you can access resources defined within it.
In other words, you must assign an environment to a group before you can use it. Or you would receive 404 errors while accessing every hostname in the environment group.

### Remediation

Make sure that you have attached at least one environment to every environment group.

You can use the following steps to add environments to an environment group:
