**Product**: [Apigee API Management](https://cloud.google.com/apigee)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong


### Description

You could choose to use a managed instance group (MIG) or Private Service Connect to send API traffic from
your network to Apigee X instances. If the API traffic is being sent through a MIG, the MIG should be created
in the network which is peered to the Apigee X instance, the MIG should also point to the correct Apigee X
instance IP.


### Remediation

[Check the status of managed instances in the MIG](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/getting-info-about-migs#verify_instances)
created in the project which contains VPC network which needs to be connected to Apigee and ensure that the instances
have the following metadata configured:
- startup-script-url: gs://apigee-5g-saas/apigee-envoy-proxy-release/latest/conf/startup-script.sh
- ENDPOINT: $APIGEE_INSTANCE_ENDPOINT


### Further information

- - You can find step-by-step details in the [Configure routing](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/install-cli#externalmig) step from Apigee X provisioning guide.
