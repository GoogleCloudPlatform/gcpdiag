 Backend Service Timeout for Global External Application Load Balancers
---

**Product**: [Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

The default timeout is 30 seconds for external application load balancers
and we don't recommend backend service timeout values greater than 24 hours
(86,400 seconds) because Google Cloud periodically restarts GFEs for software
updates and other routine maintenance. The longer the backend service timeout
value, the more likely it is that Google Cloud terminates TCP connections for
maintenance.

### Remediation

Implement Retry Logic in Client Systems for Long Running Connections:
Ensure client systems can handle retries if the TCP connection cannot remain open for long periods.

related to backend service timeout.
