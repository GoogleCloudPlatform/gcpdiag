**Product**: [Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

Connection draining is a process that ensures that existing, in-progress
requests are given time to complete when a virtual machine (VM) instance is
removed from an instance group or when an endpoint is removed from network
endpoint groups (NEGs).

Performance best practices recommend configuring connection draining
timeout to allow existing requests to complete when instances are removed
from a backend service.

### Remediation

Set connection draining timeout on an existing backend service.
