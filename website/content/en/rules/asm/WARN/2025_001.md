  ASM: Envoy doesn't report connection failure
---
**Product**: [Anthos Service Mesh](https://cloud.google.com/anthos \
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

The error code 111 typically corresponds to the ECONNREFUSED error in Linux
which means that the connection was refused by the server(sidecar). This
generally indicates that no process is listening on the IP:Port combination that
the client is trying to connect to

### Remediation

Verify that the application port in the pod is correctly configured and
responding to the defined server port. Use tools like curl or netcat to test
connectivity to the application port from within the pod. Ensure there are no
misconfigurations or firewall rules blocking the connection.
