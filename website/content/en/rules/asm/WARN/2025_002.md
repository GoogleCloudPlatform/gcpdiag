  ASM: Upstream connection established successfully with no protocol errors
---
**Product**: [Anthos Service Mesh](https://cloud.google.com/anthos)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description
The error "upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers.
reset reason: protocol error" typically indicates a invalid headers during
the connection establishment between Envoy and the upstream service.
This could occur when Envoy receives headers that are not properly formatted
contain duplicates, or conflict with each other
(e.g., multiple Transfer-Encoding headers) leading to a protocol error.

### Remediation
To remediate the "upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers
reset reason: protocol error": Ensure the upstream service is not sending
duplicate or conflicting headers, such as multiple Transfer-Encoding headers
Validate the headers are properly formatted and comply with HTTP standards
You can also perform a PCAP capture on the application pod to check the
response headers being sent by application.
