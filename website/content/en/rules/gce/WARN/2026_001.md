  GCE boot disk auto-delete is enabled.
---

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

When a VM instance is deleted, the boot disk should typically be deleted as well
to avoid orphaned disks that continue to incur storage costs. If auto-delete is
disabled on the boot disk, the disk will remain after the VM is deleted, which
may lead to unexpected costs and resource cleanup issues.

This rule checks that boot disks have auto-delete enabled. Exceptions may apply
for instances where boot disk preservation is intentionally configured for
backup or recovery purposes.

### Remediation

To enable auto-delete on the boot disk, use the following command:

```
gcloud compute instances set-disk-auto-delete INSTANCE_NAME \
    --disk DISK_NAME \
    --auto-delete \
    --zone ZONE
```

Alternatively, you can update this setting in the Google Cloud Console:
1. Go to **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**
2. Click on the instance name
3. Click **Edit**
4. Under **Boot disk**, check **Delete boot disk when instance is deleted**
5. Click **Save**
