  Secure Boot is enabled
---

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

Google recommends enabling Secure Boot if you can ensure that it doesn't
prevent a representative test VM from booting and if it is appropriate
for your workload. Compute Engine does not enable Secure Boot by default
because unsigned drivers and other low-level software might not be compatible.
