 GCE VM is operating within optimal performance thresholds
---

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

Checks the performance of the GCE instances in a project -
CPU Usage, Memory Usage, Disk Usage and Serial port logs erros.
Threshold for CPU Usage, Memory Usage, Disk Usage is 95%.

### Remediation

To understand the performance of GCE VM, please [review the instance monitoring
metrics](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance#viewing-performance-metrics)
related to CPU, Memory, Network and Disks.

- **CPU and Memory metrics:** Consistently high CPU or memory utilization indicate
the need to scale up a VM. If the VM consistently uses greater than 90% of its
CPU or memory, [change the VM's machine type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance#changing_a_machine_type)
to a machine type with more vCPUs or memory.

- **Network metrics:** Consistently high outgoing network traffic might indicate
the need to [change the VM's machine type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance#changing_a_machine_type)
to a machine type that has a higher egress bandwidth limit. If you notice high
numbers of incoming packets denied by firewalls, visit the
[Network Intelligence Firewall Insights page](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-intelligence/firewalls)
in the Google Cloud console to learn more about the origins of denied packets.

- **Disk Metrics:** I/O latency is dependent on queue length and I/O size. If the
queue length or I/O size for a disk is high, the latency will also be high.
If any storage performance metrics indicate disk performance issues, do one
or more of the following:
    - Review [Optimizing persistent disk performance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/optimizing-pd-performance)
    and implement the best practices suggested to improve performance.
    - [Resize the persistent disks](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance#:~:text=Resize%20the%20persistent%20disks)
    to increase the per-disk IOPS and throughput limits. Persistent disks do
    not have any reserved, unusable capacity, so you can use the full disk
    without performance degradation.
    - [Change the disk type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance#:~:text=Change%20the%20disk%20type)
    to a disk type that offers higher performance. For more information, see
    [Configure disks to meet performance requirements](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance).
