  Pub/Sub push subscription service agent has the Service Account Token Creator Role.
---

**Product**: [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/)
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

The Pub/Sub service agent (`service-{project-number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) must be granted the Service Account Token Creator Role (`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`) on the service account used by a push subscription with authentication enabled.

Without this role, Pub/Sub cannot generate tokens to authenticate to the push endpoint, leading to message delivery failures.

### Remediation

To fix this issue, grant the `Service Account Token Creator` role to the Pub/Sub service agent for the service account used in the push subscription.

Execute the following `gcloud` command:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL" \
  --member="serviceAccount:service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
```

Replace the following:
- `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The email address of the service account used in your push subscription.
- `PROJECT_NUMBER`: Your Google Cloud project number.
