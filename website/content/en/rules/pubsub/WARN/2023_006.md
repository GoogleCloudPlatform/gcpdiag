  Push delivery requests for push subscriptions are not failing.

**Product**: [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

For any push subscription, delivery to the endpoint should return an ack
response for successfully processed messages.

### Remediation

For push subscriptions the error code returned by the endpoint if it's not
listed in the ack [http status codes](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/push#receive_push),
and resolve the occurring issue. Logging within the endpoint system may help in
debugging the processing error.

For [export subscriptions](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscription-overview#push_pull),
attach a [dead-letter topic](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/handling-failures#dead_letter_topic)
and subscription, pull from this dead-letter subscription and check the [attributes](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/handling-failures#track-delivery-attempts)
of the resulting messages for the processing error.
