  -p serial_console_file=value
```

#### Parameters

| Name | Required | Default | Type | Help |
|------|----------|---------|------|------|
| `project_id` | True | None | str | The Project ID associated with the VM for which you want to                 analyse the Serial logs. |
| `name` | False | None | str | The name of the VM, for which you want to analyse the Serial logs. Or provide the id i.e -p name=<str> |
