**Product**: [Cloud NAT](https://cloud.google.com/nat)\
**Step Type**: AUTOMATED STEP

### Description

This step determines whether the NATGW is dropping packets. NAT gateways could be dropping
  packets for various reasons; however, the drops are not always indicative of an issue

### Success Reason

   No received_packet_drop on NAT GW {nat_gateway_name} seen.

### Uncertain Reason

   Elevated received_packet_drop_count metric noticed for NAT GW {nat_gateway_name}
   dropped_received_packet: {metric_value}

### Uncertain Remediation

   NAT gateways could be dropping packets for various reasons; however, the drops are not always indicative of an issue.
   Checking received_packet_drop metrics at the VM level as well. Open a case to GCP Support for confirmation
   of the reason for the drops
