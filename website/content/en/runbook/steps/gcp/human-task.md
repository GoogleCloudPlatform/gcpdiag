### Description

This is special step in a runbook designed for situations where automated
    verification is not possible, and human judgment is required. It prompts
    the operator (a human user) to manually check and confirm whether an issue is occurring.
    This can involve accessing a system, reviewing configurations, or validating the state
    of a resource based on provided instructions.
