**Step Type**: COMPOSITE STEP

### Description

None

### Failure Reason

Found logs messages related to "{log}" on the cluster: {cluster_name}.

### Failure Remediation

This issue occurs when Spark Jobs was not able to find available port after 1000 retries.
COLSE_WAIT connections are possible cause of this issue.
To identify any CLOSE_WAIT connections, please analyze the netstat output.

1. netstat plant >> open_connections.txt
2. cat open_connections.txt | grep “CLOSE_WAIT”

If the blocked connections are due to a specific application, restarting that application is recommended.
Alternatively, restarting the master node will also release the affected connections.

### Success Reason

Didn't find logs messages related to "{log}" on the cluster: {cluster_name}.
