**Step Type**: COMPOSITE STEP

### Description

None

### Failure Reason

Found logs messages related to "{log}" on the cluster: {cluster_name}.

### Failure Remediation

If allocated memory appears insufficient, consider increasing the spark.executor.memory configuration to allocate additional memory.[1]
If memory allocation seems adequate, investigate potential garbage collection optimization. The Apache Spark documentation provides a comprehensive guide on Garbage Collection Tuning.[2]
Additionally, there is some guidance that tuning spark.memory.fraction can be effective, particularly for workloads that heavily rely on RDD caching. See Memory Management Overview for more discussion of this configuration property.
