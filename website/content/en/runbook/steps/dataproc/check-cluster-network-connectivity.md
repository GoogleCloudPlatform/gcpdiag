**Product**: [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc)\
**Step Type**: AUTOMATED STEP

### Description

The Compute Engine Virtual Machine instances (VMs) in a Dataproc cluster must
  be able to communicate with each other using ICMP, TCP (all ports), and UDP
  (all ports) protocols.

### Failure Reason

The network communication among nodes in cluster {cluster_name} is blocked.

### Failure Remediation

You must create your own rule that meets Dataproc connectivity requirements[1] and apply it to your clusterâ€™s VPC network.
Please check the documentation[2] for more details.

### Success Reason

The network communication among nodes in cluster {cluster_name} is working.

### Uncertain Reason

The cluster has not been found, it may have been deleted. Skipping the connectivity test.

### Uncertain Remediation

Please check if the Dataproc connectivity requirements[1] are satisfied.
