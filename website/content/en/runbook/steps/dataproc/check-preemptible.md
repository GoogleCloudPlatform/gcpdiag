**Product**: [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc)\
**Step Type**: AUTOMATED STEP

### Description

None

### Failure Reason

Cluster {cluster.name} uses preemptible workers and their count exceeds 50% of the total worker count leading to shuffle fetch failures.

### Failure Remediation

To improve stability:

- Reduce the number of preemptible workers.
- Use non-preemptible workers.
- Explore Enhanced Flexibility Mode (EFM) for better control over preemptible instances.

### Success Reason

Cluster {cluster.name} uses preemptible workers. While within the recommended limit, preemptions might still lead to FetchFailedExceptions.
