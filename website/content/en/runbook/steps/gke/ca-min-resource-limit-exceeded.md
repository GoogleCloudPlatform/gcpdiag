  Check for "no.scale.down.node.minimal.resource.limits.exceeded" log entries
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Step Type**: AUTOMATED STEP

### Description

None

### Failure Reason

The scaleDown event failed because it would violate cluster-wide minimal resource limits.
These are the resource limits set for node auto-provisioning.
Example log entry that would help identify involved objects:
{log_entry}

### Failure Remediation

Review your limits for memory and vCPU and, if you want cluster autoscaler to scale down this node, decrease the limits
by following the documentation
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-provisioning#enable

### Success Reason

No "no.scale.down.node.minimal.resource.limits.exceeded" errors found between {start_time} and {end_time}
