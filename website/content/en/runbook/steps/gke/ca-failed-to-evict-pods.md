### Description

None

### Failure Reason

The scaleDown event failed because some of the Pods could not be evicted from a node.
Example log entry that would help identify involved objects:
{log_entry}

### Failure Remediation

Review best practices for Pod Disruption Budgets to ensure that the rules allow for eviction of application replicas
when acceptable.
