  This will confirm if there is any VPC flow logs to destination IP.

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Step Type**: AUTOMATED STEP

### Description

This will either rule out ip-masq issue or points to ip-mas-agent issue.

### Failure Reason

There are no egress traffic to Destination IP which indicates that GKE NODE is also having issue to connect to
destination IP.

### Failure Remediation

Enable VPC flow logs by following the documentation and look if traffic id going out to destination:
<https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-flow-logs#enable-logging-existing>

### Success Reason

When VPC flow logs shows traffic is going out, then GKE IP masquerading may be working as intended. If the end-to-end
case is still failing, the problem is likely to be somewhere in the networking path between Dest-IP and node on which
impacted Pod is scheduled.
