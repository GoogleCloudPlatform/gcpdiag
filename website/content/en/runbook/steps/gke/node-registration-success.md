  Verify Node Registration Checker output

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Step Type**: AUTOMATED STEP

### Description

None

### Failure Reason

Node {node} in zone {location} is currently running, but it failed registration with kube-apiserver, below is the Node
Registration Checker summary:

{log_entries[0]}
{log_entries[1]}
{log_entries[2]}
{log_entries[3]}
{log_entries[4]}
{log_entries[5]}
{log_entries[6]}
{log_entries[7]}
{log_entries[8]}
{log_entries[9]}
{log_entries[10]}
{log_entries[11]}
{log_entries[12]}
{log_entries[13]}
{log_entries[14]}
{log_entries[15]}

### Failure Remediation

To understand why the node failed registration with kube-apiserver, please check the following documentation page:
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/troubleshooting/node-registration#use-nrc

### Success Reason

Node {node} is currently running and, according to the output from Node Registration Checker, it was registered
successfully. Below is the log entry that shows successful registration:

{log_entry}

### Uncertain Reason

The node {node} in the zone {location} is running, but there are no logs generated by Node Registration Checker in the
provided time range {start_time} - {end_time}.

### Uncertain Remediation

This runbook looks for logs generated by Node Registration Checker. Because there are no logs from Node Registration
Checker for the node {node}, but it is running, there could be a different issue with the node.
Please try the runbook with a different node in the same nodepool.


### Failure Reason [Alternative 2]

Node {node} in zone {location} is not currently running. While checking logs it was found that it failed registration
with kube-apiserver. Below is the Node Registration Checker summary:

{log_entries[0]}
{log_entries[1]}
{log_entries[2]}
{log_entries[3]}
{log_entries[4]}
{log_entries[5]}
{log_entries[6]}
{log_entries[7]}
{log_entries[8]}
{log_entries[9]}
{log_entries[10]}
{log_entries[11]}
{log_entries[12]}
{log_entries[13]}
{log_entries[14]}
{log_entries[15]}


### Failure Reason [Alternative 3]

Could not find summary from Node Registration Checker for node {node} in zone {location}. The node might have been
deleted before Node Registration Checker could finish running.

### Failure Remediation [Alternative 3]

Try to run the runbook with a node that is currently running.
