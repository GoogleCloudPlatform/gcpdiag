  The connection to restricted.googleapis.com or private.googleapis.com is timing out
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Step Type**: AUTOMATED STEP

### Description

None

### Failure Reason

The connection from Node to restricted.googleapis.com (199.36.153.4/30) or private.googleapis.com (199.36.153.8/30) is
timing out, preventing image pull. It is probable that a firewall rule is blocking this IP range. A firewall to permit
this egress should be created.
Example log entry that would help identify involved objects:

{log_entry}

### Failure Remediation

Follow the documentation:
https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/set-up-private-connectivity

### Success Reason

No "Failed to pull image.*dial tcp.*199.36.153.\d:443: i/o timeout" errors found between {start_time} and {end_time}
UTC
