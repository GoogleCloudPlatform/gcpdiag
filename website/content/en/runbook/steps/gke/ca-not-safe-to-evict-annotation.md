**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\

### Description

None

### Failure Reason

The scaleDown event failed because a Pod on the node has the safe-to-evict=false annotation
Example log entry that would help identify involved objects:
{log_entry}

### Failure Remediation

If the Pod can be safely evicted, edit the manifest of the Pod and update the annotation to
"cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict": "true".

### Success Reason

No "no.scale.down.node.pod.not.safe.to.evict.annotation" errors found between {start_time} and {end_time}
