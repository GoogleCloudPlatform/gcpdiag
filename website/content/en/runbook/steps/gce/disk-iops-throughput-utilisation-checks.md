  Checking if the Disk IOPS/throughput usage is within optimal levels
---

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Step Type**: AUTOMATED STEP

### Description

None

### Failure Reason

Disk IOPS/Throughput usage is NOT within optimal limits

### Failure Remediation

There can be multiple reasons which can cause Disk IOPS/Throughput usage to increase:

- Application and GuestOS Operations - Unmanaged and untested application workloads can cause the high influx of IOs
to the disk and cause IO operations to be queued, causing throttling at disk levels.

- CPU Starvation - Small instances(with lesser CPUs) may not have enough CPU to serve all I/Os inflight.
<https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance#cpu_and_memory_performance>

- Network Throttling - High sent/received network traffic can cause network throttling, that can also impacts disk
operations.
<https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance#network_performance>

- Insufficient Machine Resources - If your machine's IOPS and throughput limits are not enough to serve your workloads,
this can also cause CPU or Disk IOPS/throughput Starvation.

To fix this issue:

- Please optimize your application workloads.
- If needed, please add more resources(CPU, Memory) to the VM.
- Please optimize your Disk performance -

- If needed, please change your disk type to get better Disk IOPS/throughput limits -
