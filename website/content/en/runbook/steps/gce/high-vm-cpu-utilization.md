  Evaluates the CPU of a VM for high utilization that might indicate performance issues.
---

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Step Type**: AUTOMATED STEP

### Description

This step determines whether the CPU utilization of the VM exceeds a predefined threshold,
  indicating potential performance degradation. It utilizes metrics from the Ops Agent if installed,
  or hypervisor-visible metrics as a fallback, to accurately assess CPU performance and identify any
  issues requiring attention.

### Failure Reason

CPU utilization on this VM has surpassed recommended operational levels,
which may affect its performance and SSH connectivity.

### Failure Remediation

Excessive CPU usage can lead to performance bottlenecks. Consider resizing the VM to a more
powerful machine type with higher CPU capabilities.
Detailed instructions for resizing and restarting VMs are available here:
- Stopping a VM: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stop-start-instance
- Resizing a VM: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance#gcloud

Additionally, use the Compute Engine observability metrics for an in-depth analysis to pinpoint high-usage processes:
* https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/observe-monitor-vms#access_vm_observability_metrics
* https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/observe-monitor-vms#process_utilization

Alternatively, you can connect via serial console if SSH is unavailable to stop offending processes
(https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-using-serial-console).

### Success Reason

The Compute Engine VM {full_resource_path},
has CPU utilization within the optimal range.
