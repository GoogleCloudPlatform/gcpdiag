**Product**: [Load balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing)\
**Step Type**: AUTOMATED STEP

### Description

None

### Failure Reason

The forwarding rule has a backend latency of {average_latency} ms. This is higher than the threshold value of {threshold} ms.

### Failure Remediation

Investigate the increased backend latency. Check the health and performance of the backend instances, examining metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and disk I/O.

### Success Reason

The forwarding rule has a backend latency of {average_latency} ms. This is less than the threshold value of {threshold} ms.
