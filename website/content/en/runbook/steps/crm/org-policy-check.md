### Description

Supports only boolean constraints and not list constraints.

### Failure Reason

The {constraint} policy is {actual_state} however should be {expected_state}.

### Failure Remediation

Follow Guide [1] to correct the constraint. Search for the constraint in [2] to better understand
how it works.

Note: You may want to doublecheck with your organization admins of the best approach here.
